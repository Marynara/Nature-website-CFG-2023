            Nestled between mountains and forest in Pusteria Valley in the South
            Tyrol region of northern Italy, Lake Braies offers the most
            breath-taking views. It boasts 31 hectares and is located at an
            altitude of 1,500m above sea level. The lake, with an average depth
            of 17 m, measures 36 m at its lowest point and is the ultimate
            attraction for recreation seekers, nature lovers and hikers, in both
            summer and winter. It is highly recommended for people of all ages
            as well as for couples, families and solo explorers.

            Legend has it that the gateway to the underground kingdom of Fanes
            (whose people are the original inhabitants of the Dolomites) is at
            the south end of the lake below the
            <i>Croda del Becco (Seekofel Mountain)</i> which could only be
            reached by boat. In modern times, due to the Italian TV series
            <i>Un passo da cielo</i> the lake has only become more popular,
            attracting the attention of domestic and international tourists
            alike.

              <u>How to get there:</u> <br />The easiest way to get here is by
              car but public transport is also available. From Bolzano you can
              take the train to Villabassa (Niederdorf) and from there catch the
              local bus 442 to the lake for €3. Please note that the local bus
              only runs seasonally from June 20th to September 20th.

          <ul>
            <li>
              The lake can be visited all year round, expect highs of 20 in the
              summer and lows of -10 in the winter.
            </li>
            <li>
              The 3.2km path around the lake takes around 1.5-2hrs to complete
              and offers spectacular scenery.
            </li>
            <li>
              From May to October you can rent a boat to share with others from
              the local wooden cabin for 30mins (€15). Alternatively, you can
              have the boat all to yourself (€50). If you are interested in a
              private boat sunrise photoshoot, personal photographers are
              available but they cannot be reserved more than 4 days in advance.
              For the more adventurous, e-bikes are available to rent for the
              day (€69) which include a 30min shared boat ride.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you would like to use a drone in the area, you must request a
              permit from the administrative office of the Fanes-Senes-Braies
              Natural Park.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you would like to spend the night in this magical place, Hotel
              Lago di Braies is situated almost directly on the shore of the
              lake. Booking is recommended 2-3 months in advance. The hotel has
              a parking if you plan to come by car. If you are looking for a
              less expensive opton, Hotel Tenker is only 5 minutes by car from
              the lake.
