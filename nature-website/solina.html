        Solina Lake is an artificial lake in the Bieszczady Mountains region.
        That largest in Poland water reservoir is surrounded by a characteristic
        landscape of mountains covered with forest.

            The lake was created in 1968 by the construction of the Solina Dam
            on the San River. It has an area of 22 square kilometres and
            contains 472,000,000 cubic metres of water, making it Poland's
            largest artificial lake. The area is very popular with sailors for
            whom several marinas and quays were built. You can swim, sail and
            canoe, paddle and pedal boat as well as go surfing (here is
            forbidden to use engine on boats). The lake's great depth, water
            clarity, and mountainous scenery makes it a very popular
            destination.

            There are plenty of beaches with tourist infrastructure as well as
            many wild and desolated that provide peace. There are few islands on
            the water. Solina Lake is one of the most landscape-changing water
            reservoirs in Poland. Picturesque peninsulas and coves captivate
            with their beauty and naturalness. And if someone wants to admire
            the exceptional and unique panorama of the Solina Lake, the
            Myczkowiecki Lagoon, the Bieszczady Mountains and the Słone
            Mountains? The Solina gondola railway is the newest and most modern
            facility of the Polish Cable Railways in Poland.

          <h5>Tips & friendly reminders</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The surroundings of the Solina Lake are frequently visited by
              tourists and holidaymakers. Several recreational centers were
              established on its shores, and on the west shore of the lake there
              is the well-known spa town Polańczyk.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the vicinity of the lake you can also see valuable building
              monuments - wooden buildings as well as brick buildings - in,
              among other things. Uherce, Orelec, Srednia Wies and Polana.
            </li>
            <li>
              Visitors can take a boat cruise during which they will hear the
              history of Lake Solina; those into water sports can rent a paddle
              boat, row boat or a canoe. Swimming in Lake Solina outside the
              designated areas is extremely dangerous. It is therefore
              absolutely forbidden to swim in these areas.
            </li>
            <li>
              Solina also has attractions for walking trip fans. Gorgeous views
              and numerous walking trails encourage tourists to take long and
              delightful walks.
